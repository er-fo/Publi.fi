# Stripe Payment Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Frontend (GitHub Pages)
- ✅ Updated to use new Google Apps Script URL
- ✅ Waitlist functionality working properly
- ✅ All Stripe payment integration code prepared

### Backend (Google Apps Script)
- ✅ Enhanced script with Stripe payment intent creation
- ✅ Secure implementation using PropertiesService
- ✅ Database schema updates for payment tracking
- ✅ MVP access confirmation emails

## 🔧 Next Steps Required

### 1. Update Google Apps Script

1. **Open Google Apps Script**: Go to your existing script at https://script.google.com
2. **Replace the code**: Copy the entire content from `enhanced_google_apps_script_with_stripe.js`
3. **Add Stripe Secret Key Securely**:
   - Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
   - Click "Script properties"
   - Add new property:
     - **Key**: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
     - **Value**: `[Your Stripe Secret Key - provided separately]`
4. **Save and Deploy**: Save the script and deploy a new version

### 2. Update Google Sheets Schema

Your spreadsheet needs additional columns for payment tracking:

**Add these columns after column G (Timestamp):**
- **Column H**: `Payment_Status` (values: WAITLIST, PAID)
- **Column I**: `Payment_Intent_ID` (Stripe payment intent ID)
- **Column J**: `Stripe_Customer_ID` (for future use)
- **Column K**: `Payment_Date` (when payment was completed)

### 3. Current Status

- ✅ New Google Apps Script URL configured: `AKfycbywjjPRN5cKZtHq468zdcQOBvVWMdsrhkBngnyXb5D42zckoAEsD3EQnwSX7u5Cn1Z_0Q`
- ✅ URL verified working: "Publify Waitlist & Payment API is running!"
- ✅ Waitlist signup functionality active
- ⏳ Stripe payment integration ready for activation

### 4. Test the Integration

1. **Test Waitlist Signup**: Ensure the basic waitlist still works ✅
2. **Test Payment Flow**: 
   - Ready for testing once Stripe key is added
   - Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

## 🎯 Payment Flow (Ready to Activate)

The payment system is fully implemented and ready. Once you add the Stripe secret key to Google Apps Script properties, users will experience:

1. User signs up for waitlist (currently working)
2. Payment offer appears (ready to activate)
3. Secure Stripe payment processing
4. Confirmation emails and database updates

## 🔒 Security Features
