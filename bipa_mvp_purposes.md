**Core Idea: Build-in-Public Assistant (BIPA)**

**Objective:**
Provide indie developers and SaaS builders with a fully automated content assistant that transforms real GitHub activity into authentic, engaging Twitter and Reddit posts—requiring only user approval—so they can grow an audience while staying focused on building.

**MVP Overview:**
BIPA automates the end-to-end workflow of building in public, from pulling GitHub activity and generating content to discovering engagement opportunities and scheduling posts. The only user input required is to approve or edit suggested content.

**Core Features:**

1. **OAuth Integration**

   - Twitter (X): Read and post tweets, replies, and retweets
   - Reddit: Read and post submissions and comments
   - GitHub: Read commit history, pull requests, issues, and repository metadata (public and private)

   *Purpose: To securely connect to users' accounts across GitHub, Twitter, and Reddit, enabling seamless data access and content publishing without requiring manual exports or multiple tools.*

2. **GitHub-Based Update Generator**

   - Automatically pulls recent activity from connected GitHub repositories
     - Commits, pull requests, issue updates, new repositories
   - AI generates short-form content suggestions based on GitHub activity
     - Tweet drafts
     - Reddit post and comment drafts
   - Focuses on progress, learning moments, and shipping updates
   - Suggestions are placed into a review queue for user approval

   *Purpose: To convert real development work into consistent, insightful public updates, making it easy for builders to share meaningful progress without needing to craft posts from scratch.*

3. **Engagement Assistant**

   - **Twitter**
     - Identifies 20–30 relevant tweets using keywords and user-follow graph
       - Drafts contextual replies aligned with user tone
     - Highlights 5–10 tweets for potential retweets or quote-tweets
   - **Reddit**
     - Surfaces high-value threads in selected subreddits
     - Suggests personalized comments based on user history and GitHub context

   *Purpose: To help users organically participate in relevant conversations, boosting visibility and credibility in their niche without having to manually search for opportunities.*

4. **Approval Workflow**

   - Central dashboard for reviewing all generated content and engagement actions
   - Each item can be approved, edited, or discarded
   - Once approved, content is automatically scheduled for optimal posting time
   - Users retain full control but avoid manual labor
   - *This is so that it actually is allowed, under Reddit's and Twitter's ToS, as it isn't just spam.*

   *Purpose: To preserve user authenticity, ensure compliance with platform rules, and eliminate the risk of unwanted automated behavior.*

5. **Automated Scheduling and Publishing**

   - Approved content is automatically queued and posted based on engagement timing algorithms
   - Includes support for posting threads, replies, quote tweets, and Reddit comments
   - Retry logic and rate-limit handling ensures smooth delivery

   *Purpose: To ensure content reaches its audience at optimal times without requiring manual scheduling or follow-up, maximizing engagement with minimal effort.*

6. **Customization and Personalization**

   - Configure tone, length, and style of generated content
   - Set preferences for engagement frequency and platform priority
   - Filter keywords and subreddits to target the right communities

   *Purpose: To align the assistant's output with the user's personal brand and audience, giving creators full control over how they show up online.*

**Included by Design:**

- Automated scheduling of approved posts
- Optional editing before publishing
- Continuous discovery of new engagement targets
- Personalized tone and cadence settings
- Multi-platform delivery and content alignment

**Primary Benefit:**
Enables SaaS founders and indie devs to grow a loyal audience by publicly sharing real product progress—with near-zero friction—so they can focus on building while BIPA handles the rest.
